# Rickert Comic Book Viewer
Rickert is a web-based comic book viewer that features a panel by panel mode. It has been built from the ground up to be functional on small screen devices, such as mobiles.

## Status
At the moment, Rickert is entirely made of frontend JavaScript.

An optional backend is planned, allowing for CBZ files, transcoding, and additional features.
